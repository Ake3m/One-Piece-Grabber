# One Piece Grabber
One piece grabber is a python script made to grab one piece chapters. Made since I was tired of all the annoying ads on manga sites.

## Dependencies needed
1. pip install beautifulsoup4
2. pip install requests

## How it works
It scrapes a manga website by using the request and beautiful soup library. Once it does this, it'll show the 5 most recent chapter and prompt the user for the chapter they'd like to request. Once the chapter is given, it'll create a folder on the system with the chapter number as it's name and start downloading the manga pages. 

## Example

Run the python script
